# avensure_tech_task

<strong>Introduction</strong><br>
This task took approx. 20 hours to complete. It contains a mix of oop/procedural concepts. I made a few planning errors in the beginning that I felt necessary to fix at the back end of the task. I did not think through an appropriate project folder structure which meant that too many of my documents were in the root directory. I fixed this by adopting a similar structure learned through using Laravel e.g. my two controller functions were placed inside /Http/Controllers and my two model classes (Post and Category) were placed in a Models folder.

<strong>Planning</strong><br>
I do have a tendency to jump into a project a bit quickly after a small amount of mental planning. It is clearly an area of improvement as I seek to gain employment working on larger, more complex projects.

<strong>Folder Structure</strong><br>
As mentioned in the introduction, I improved my folder structure gradually as I progress through the task. This was, in itself, a good learning activity but probably cost me 1/2 hours in development time as I organised my files into a more standard hierachy and then fixed resulting bugs.

<strong>Use Of Programming Languages</strong>
1. HTML
I felt comfortable with my use of HTML, applying appropriate classes (Bootstrap and custom) to achieve styling requirements.
2. Javascript
I felt a little rusty with JS since I am more accustomed to using Jquery. However I quickly got back up to speed, researching where necessary and constructing required functions with the aid of occasional snippets of code taken from forums. I included all my js code within index.php but this can 
3. PHP
I was pleased with the php code I created. As I mentioned at interview, although I have used Laravel extensively to build my own personal project, I don't have a great deal of experience building a project using OOP concepts. I therefore took advantage of the opportunity to build a couple of class files (2 Models). I felt comfortable adding the properties and methods needed to these class files.

<strong>Validation</strong><br>
All my validation has been completed on the front end using JS.

<strong>Styling Methodology</strong><br>
Since the task suggested a styling framework I chose to use Bootstrap together with a custom css file. It is likely that I could have acheieved all my styling using Bootstrap and would probably do so if I started the task again. My use of css was a little disorganised and I need to improve this in future projects. In particular, having learned about SCSS in my personal project I would choose it over plain css since it allows for convenient variable declarations and nested styling.

<strong>Responsiveness</strong><br>
This project is perhaps minimally responsive in the sense that it has been styled to present content according to screen orientation. In a real project I would presume that more tested would be needed to ensure the project present correctly across all devices.

<strong>UX/UI</strong><br>
An option to add an image to each post would have improved the overall visual appeal of the blog. I am happy with my use of icons (fontawesome) and colour coded categories. I suspect there is more to UX/UI than icons and colours tho :)

<strong>Browser Tools</strong><br>
I used chrome to help investigate any bugs using the elements, console, network tabs

<strong>GIT</strong><br>
I used Github desktop to create a local repository and publish it to github. As I developed my project I was conscious that a change in strategy I adopted (e.g. more logical folder structure adopted) would almost certainly cause bugs. I could have created a branch at this point to allow me to safely return to the original version should problems within the limited timescale prove unmanageable.

<strong>HTTP Response Management</strong><br>
This is definitely an area for improvement and my project perhaps does not manage this to the expected standard. However the function called 'displayPost' within index.html does generate an error for the user and logs the error code to the browser console for any error other than 200(success).

<strong>Summary</strong><br>
This project has been my first application tech task and it has been an enjoyable experience.
